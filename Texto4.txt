Grace, what have you done?
Murdered for me on that cross
Accused in absence of wrong
My sin washed away in your blood
Too much to make sense of it all
I know that your love breaks my fall
The scandal of grace, you died in my place
So my soul will live
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there is no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
Death, where is your sting?
Your power is as dead as my sin
The cross has taught me to live
In mercy, my heart now to sing
The day and its trouble shall come
I know that your strength is enough
The scandal of grace, you died in my place
So my soul will live
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there is no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there is no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
And it is all because of you, Jesus
It is all because of you, Jesus
It is all because of your love
And my soul will live
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there is no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there is no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand
And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You have never failed and You will not start now
So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
I will call upon Your name
Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine
